Spotify Recommender is a project that aims to build a recommender system on top of the Spotify Million Playlist Dataset. It is realized as a web application powered by modern technologies like React, Spring Boot and PostgreSQL. Using the Spotify Web API, it is fully integrated with Spotify allowing users to login with Spotify as well as obtaining and displaying detailed user, track, album and artist information.
