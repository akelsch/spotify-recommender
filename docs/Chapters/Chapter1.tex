\section{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It exists an increase demand on good recommender systems.
    \item Build an attractive and good recommender system for users, providing songs that the users might find good as well.
    \item Provide to users a different recommender system than the spotify one, with new features, e.g., option to rate the songs and display a rank for them.
    \item Make profitable the fact that we go to the point, focusing on displaying discovered songs, while spotify is a more general application.
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Goals reached:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Application developed according to the requirements:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Dashboard page.
            \item Recently played page.
            \item Discover page.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Main objectives and requirements, e.g., discover functionality, were mostly achieved. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Goals not reached:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Filter by genre
        \item Show to the user briefly how our system decides which songs are likely to be recommended.
        \item Possibility to play the song in our application instead of using the Spotify website.
        \item Usage of deeplearning4j library and embeddings approach were not included to recommend songs.
        \item Brief amount of songs displayed due to API limitations to fetch songs, max:50.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
